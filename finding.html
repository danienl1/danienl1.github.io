				User Interviews
			</h2>
			<p>
				User interviews were a significant part of my design and development. Through these interviews, I got a grasp of what various stakeholders would expect to see out of a professional portfolio. To seek out their perspective, I asked them serveral questions along the lines of what should be presented, what should be displayed, organization, structure, and depth. This allowed me to identify who my users are, what they expect to see, how they could want to see it realized, all while eliminating my personal assumptions and bias. To do my interviews, I sought out those who have been in my shoes before and have made their own portfolios, as well as those in a similar major who have an idea of how they would want their own portfolio.

			Competitor Analysis

			</h2>
			<p>
				A competitor analysis is a strategical way to identify other competitors that affect your product, which is done by evaluating their strengths and weaknesses as compared to your own. For my portfolio, I reviewed mainly collaborative coding platforms, such as stackoverflow and github. This is because my field of study revolves around what they offer to the community, and to build off their strengths would benefit me. What I hope to gain from this, was to attribute to my own page what has given their page such success. This included things such as visible projects and a visually appealing design. My train of thought here was that rather than reinventing the wheel, I could build upon previously build pages while adding my own blend to it. The aforementioned is particularly true for all of the computer science blogs that I stumbled upon, which a drew a great deal of inspiration from.

				Feature Value Matrix


			</h2>
			<p>	
				A feature value matrix is a representation of the values behind each feature where it defines the criteria by which the user deems each feature as necessary. This is particularly useful as it communicates with stakeholders in a manner that they are able to understand. It negates the overhead of other descriptive design tools such as personas and complicated diagrams, getting straight to the point in a clear and visually comprehendable way. I included many features in my matrix, from the design perspective to the technical functionality. This included things such as links, content, layout, and usability. I realized that the possibilities of web design and content selection were in abundance, and to prevent myself from going overboard I aimed to focus on the essence of what I wanted to deliver to my stakeholders.

			<h2>
			Feature Prioritization
			</h2>
			<p>
				I prioritized my features from what was necessary for the page to operate, to the more minor details that were more difficult to implement. For example, I prioritized my contact information and my content over fancy animations. My line of thought here was "At the end of the day what do I want my stakeholders to see?". This led me to answer with things about myself rather than how well I can script a webpage. Although this doesn't necessarily mean to abandon an aesthetic design mindset, it simply means to fill your bucket with rocks before filling it up with sand, where rocks represent the real priorities and the sand represents less critical components. This can be incorporated into building an interface as it gives a sense of what a general template should be, such as what type of information to provide and what type of features to implement before all else. From here, the user can build off of that with their own individuality and taste.

			<h2>
			User Stories
			</h2>
			<p>
				User stories are a tool in development used to capture the perspectives of an end user. This is similar to personas, except here we take it one step deeper into the mind of the user. My inspiration for my user stories came from thinking to myself what would a hiring manager who stumbled upon my page want to see. By doing so, I placed myself into that persona and reviewed other portfolios in order to get a grasp of what is plausible for an acceptance criteria. Furthermore, I thought of my peers who may want to reach out to me because of a certain project I've done to connect, and used that to develop more requirements.

			<h2>
			Cognitive Walkthrough
			</h2>
			<p>	
				A cognitive walkthrough is a usability evaluation method where an evaluator walks a user through a series of tasks and asks a variety of questions in order to gain a sense of how the product is being used and the train of thought that it brings about. This is critical in design, as it gives you the perspective of a user who is actually using your product and what is going on in their minds. This may reveal information that you might've overlooked, such as functions not being used properly or features not even being noticed. My main challenge while conducting cognitive walkthroughs was that my page lacked functionality and design at the time and therefore did not reap the full benefits of a thorough analysis. Although I did gain important insight from this, I realized that my lack of functionality in my own page was a shortcoming as although it did entail simplicity, it was too simplistic and did not ingrain users with any sense of excitement.

			<h2>User Test</h2>
			<p>
				The two tests I conducted revolved around functionality and design. I wanted to first make sure that any functionality I implemented would indeed be recognized by the user. Secondly, I wanted to test the aesthetics of my design and see where I needed areas of improvement. The most difficult aspect of this was eliciting insightful responses from my testers. Many of them answered in a sentence or less, which only gave me a sense of how I could improve rather than a detailed description.

			<h1>Summary of Findings</h1> </a> 

			<p class = "summary">
			In my findings, I quickly realized many things. I realized that my initial design mindset was too simplistic and did not foster enough creativity. From my user research and testing, I found out that my users wanted to see more than a simple and bland page. Once I realized this, I went back to the drawing board and sketched out multiple wireframes and researched various other portfolio pages in order to gain a better perspective on incorporating creativity and interaction within my design. This led me to develop better design skills overall, as I learned to structure my page better and to use efficient placement and interaction features. Through user stories, I gained a lot of insight on how and why certain content should be provided, such as my projects and information. This gave me a large realization enough to devote a section soley to projects in my final design. Through my competitor analysis, I realized that the competiton out there is no joke, and that to make my page a success I would have to fundamentally understand the strengths and weaknesses of my competitors as well as my own. Although these concepts do seem intuitive at first, with enough analysis and reflection it uncovers many hidden aspects in design and human psychology that can be utilized to futher design to another level.
			<br>
			<br>
			I faced numerous challenges in order to reach all of my findings. Mainly trial and error, as I initially was absent minded and too simplistic. At first I wasn't able to gather useful information from my plain webpage. Then after I moved past that, I realized the importance of design at its essence, which is to provide users an enjoyable interaction while providing them the content that they desire in an elegant manner. Once I realized this, I had to go back to the drawing board and basically start from square one. Although it was a long road of development, I was able to reach a design that I'm proud of through numerous attempts and prototypes. Here, I realized the signficance of gathering stakeholder input, as they play a larger factor in your product at the end of the day than you do.

			<h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1> </a> 

			<p class = "summary"> 
			Through my findings, I realized that I had many things to incorporate into my portfolio. More than just code and design, I had to restructure my content as well. From my user stories, I realized that I had to include my projects so that employers can see what I have physically accomplished in my field, rather than just reading off a list of my courses. To do this, I replaced my coursework section with my projects section, and listed some projects that I was proud of. Next, through my cognitive walkthrough I quickly noticed that my design was lacking in layout design. In order to fix this, I went back to sketching and did some research on more successfuly pages by looking back at my competitive analysis and came up with a page layout that was aesthetic in my eyes. To implement this, I had to learn various new techniques and play around with code a lot in order to get the proper formatting that I had in my sketches. For instance, I differentiated each section of my page by color to give users a more enjoyable form of navigation. Secondly, I added in icons and images to give my page more life outside of plain text. Furthermore, I researched Javascript techniques to bring more interaction to a page and applied a typewriter effect to my page.
			<br>
			<br>
			The main challenges I faced with incorporating my findings was purely implementation design and technical syntax. Since I have no prior knowledge of front end development, I struggled with learning the syntax for HTML, CSS, and Javascript. A large portion of my time went into watching various videos and other online resources so that I could actualize my designs. Though this was tedious and frustrating, I enjoyed the learning process as I slowly got the hang of these new languages. Some of my technical challenges included minimal things, such as getting my text to center on a page or aligning my images properly. This was resolved through trial and error, as I was constantly testing and reforming. Similarly, I initially had trouble setting up the software to do front end development. This included setting up my files as well as Github Desktop on multiple devices. After some time, I resolved this by watching videos and reading tutorials from online sources.
